NAME

Apache::MIMEMapper - associate file extensions with PerlHandlers

SYNOPSIS

PerlModule Apache::MIMEMapper
PerlTypeHandler Apache::MIMEMapper

AddHandler Apache::RegistryFilter .pl
AddHandler Apache::SSI .html .pl

Alias /perl-bin/ /usr/local/apache/perl-bin/
<Location /perl-bin/>
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  Options +ExecCGI
  PerlSendHeader On
</Location>

DESCRIPTION

Apache::MIMEMapper extends the core AddHandler directive to allow you
to dispatch different PerlHandlers based on the file extension of the
requested resource.  This means that you can now have .pl
scripts under htdocs/ (or wherever) without resorting to a
<Files> based configuration.  

Apache::MIMEMapper also adds the ability to stack PerlHandlers
transparently using Apache::Filter.  Handlers are added to the
PerlHandler stack in the order they appear in the httpd.conf file -
PerlSetVar Filter On is set if more than one extension is associated
with a specific Perl module.

EXAMPLE

PerlModule Apache::MIMEMapper
PerlTypeHandler Apache::MIMEMapper

AddHandler Apache::RegistryFilter .pl
AddHandler Apache::SSI .html .pl

Alias /perl-bin/ /usr/local/apache/perl-bin/
<Location /perl-bin/>
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  Options +ExecCGI
  PerlSendHeader On
</Location>

In this example, .html files are scheduled for processing with
Apache::SSI.  Additionally, .pl files outside of /perl-bin are
handled by Apache::RegistryFilter and Apache::SSI (in that order).

Because the SetHandler directive supercedes all other mod_mime
directives, all files inside of /perl-bin are processed using 
Apache::Registry.

NOTES

The current logic checks AddHandler for something that looks like
a Perl module, so

AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

still works.  The criterion for deciding if Apache::MIMEMapper
intercepts the request is whether the handler is in the form
Foo::Bar - it checks for '::'.  This is not ideal, but simple
and sufficient for most cases.

FEATURES/BUGS

Apache::MIMEMapper is a PerlTypeHandler.  It does just about
everything that mod_mime does (via MIME::Types).  The only
place where it interferes is for content-negotiated requests,
where the AddLanguage and associated directives are 
necessary.  Should you need these directives, you can install
Apache::MIMEMapper as a PerlFixupHandler instead.
